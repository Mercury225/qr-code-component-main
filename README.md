# Overview
## Improvements made
Since the previous project on single-price-grid-component-master, i have made some improvements to my coding which has doubled time efficiency allowing me to complete this project quickly
- plain background as from the design image
- a consistent class naming system 
- using ARIA tags and landmark main in HTML
- using colors in variable names first in CSS

I found that a consistent width and height for this worked on all devices, quick fix! Didn't need to use flex either

## Some changes:
- I implemented 100% height and width on html and body, is this common practice? 

## please check:
- is my box-shadow too strong? how do i make it fainter but not have a large blur radius?
